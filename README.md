# about_me
I am an artist passionate about learning and exploring a wide range of interests. My hobbies include sewing, digital and 3D art, coding, murals, illustrations, and anything related to art and design. Currently, I teach art to pre-K through 8th-grade students at a non-profit foundation in Louisville, KY.
